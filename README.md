<h1>🌱 Socio-Quest | Java-Based Web App</h1>

<b>Socio-Quest is a gamified environmental advocacy platform designed to incentivize ecological conservation through task-based challenges and competitive rewards. It leverages algorithmic task management and location-verified activity to make sustainability interactive, measurable, and fun.</b><br>
<br>
**🚀 Key Features & Technical Implementation:**

**🧩 Algorithmic Task Management:** Engineered a tiered task system (Easy, Medium, Hard) utilizing Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion) to dynamically organize challenges based on difficulty and user point-value.

**📍 Geotagged Verification:** Implemented a robust image upload verification system using Java.io and file-handling modules. The system extracts and processes metadata/geotags to ensure task authenticity based on the user's physical location.

**🎁 Integrated Rewards Ecosystem:** Developed a "Personalized Store" module where users redeem accumulated points for merchandise. I managed the complex inventory logic and transaction processing entirely within the Java backend.

**💻 Interactive UI/UX:** Built a hybrid interface using Java Swing for core application logic, seamlessly integrated with HTML5 and Inline CSS to deliver dynamic content like "Daily Facts," educational quizzes, and marquee alerts.

**📚 Educational Engagement:** Designed a knowledge-sharing component featuring real-time environmental data and interactive quizzes to improve user literacy on conservation and ecological footprints.
